# NeuroLM Organizations Vision
## Strategic Evolution from Personal AI to Business Intelligence Platform

### Current State (Personal AI System)
- Individual user accounts with personal memory and file storage
- Conversation-based interface with intelligent memory retrieval
- Multi-model AI access with quality scoring (RIAI system)
- Secure per-user data isolation and session management

### Proposed Organizations Feature Set

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Organization Creation & Management)
**Core Infrastructure:**
- Organization creation by existing users (User A creates Organization A)
- Admin role assignment (User A becomes Organization A admin)
- Member invitation system with role-based permissions
- Dual-mode operation: Personal account + Organization account switching

**Data Architecture Enhancement:**
```
Current: user_id → personal memories/files
Enhanced: user_id + org_id → shared organizational knowledge
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- Extend existing PostgreSQL schema with organization tables
- Neo4j memory segmentation by organization ID
- Organization-scoped file storage and memory retrieval
- Context switching UI between personal and organizational modes

#### Phase 2: Collaboration & Communication
**Team Features:**
- Instant messaging between organization members
- Private 1:1 chats within organization context
- Team-based conversation categorization
- Shared knowledge base with organization-wide file access

**Enhanced UI/UX:**
- Organization sidebar: Teams, departments, online members
- Message inbox for team communications
- Role-based access control for sensitive information
- Organization-specific conversation topics and categorization

#### Phase 3: Business Intelligence & Automation
**API Integration:**
- RESTful API endpoints for organization knowledge access
- Customer service chatbot integration
- Voice agent capabilities using organization memory
- External automation and workflow integration

**Advanced Features:**
- Organization-wide analytics and usage reporting
- Custom AI model training on organization data
- Advanced search across all organization content
- Integration with business tools and CRM systems

#### Phase 4: Advanced Collaboration Platform
**Communication Suite:**
- Video meeting integration with AI meeting notes
- Screen sharing with AI-powered collaboration
- Document co-editing with intelligent suggestions
- Project management integration with AI insights

**Enterprise Features:**
- Single sign-on (SSO) integration
- Advanced security and compliance features
- Custom branding and white-label options
- Enterprise-grade backup and disaster recovery

### Business Use Cases

#### Customer Service Enhancement
**Current Personal System:**
- Individual productivity assistant
- Personal conversation memory

**Organization System:**
- Shared customer knowledge base
- Team collaboration on customer issues
- API-enabled customer service automation
- Voice agent with organization-wide context

#### Revenue Model Evolution
**Personal Tier:**
- Free basic features
- Premium individual subscriptions
- Personal API access

**Organization Tier:**
- Per-seat business licensing
- Usage-based API pricing
- Enterprise features and support
- Custom integrations and training

#### Market Positioning
**From:** "Personal AI Assistant"
**To:** "Business Intelligence Platform with AI Collaboration"

### Technical Architecture Considerations

#### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- Organization management
CREATE TABLE organizations (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    admin_user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    settings JSONB DEFAULT '{}'
);

-- Organization memberships
CREATE TABLE organization_members (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    organization_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    role VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'member',
    joined_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Organization-scoped conversations
ALTER TABLE conversations ADD COLUMN organization_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id);

-- Organization-scoped files
ALTER TABLE user_files ADD COLUMN organization_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id);
```

#### Memory System Enhancement
- Extend intelligent memory retrieval to include organization context
- Neo4j relationship modeling for organization hierarchies
- Quality scoring (RIAI) at organization level for shared learning
- Privacy controls for personal vs organization memory access

#### API Design
```python
# Organization-scoped endpoints
GET /api/organizations/{org_id}/conversations
POST /api/organizations/{org_id}/chat
GET /api/organizations/{org_id}/members
POST /api/organizations/{org_id}/files
```
